    <h2 class="h">Types of Birds</h2>
    <hr color="green">
    <dl class="main">
        <dt><b>Diurnal Birds of Prey (Accipitriformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>The first type of birds is from the order Accipitriformes. It contains the diurnal birds of prey (i.e., active in the daytime), such as hawks, eagles, and ospreys. All these large birds have a sharp, hooked beak with visible nostrils.</dd>

        <dt><b>Waterfowl Birds (Anseriformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>The next kind of birds is from the order Anseriformes. Most of the birds in this classification are known birds such as ducks, swans, and geese. Birds in this order are called Waterfowl birds as they live near water sources such as marine body or freshwater ponds.</dd>

        <dt><b>Hummingbirds & Swifts (Apodiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>As per the latest taxonomic classification, both hummingbirds and swifts belong to the order Apodiformes. Most of the birds in this order are very tiny and have “underdeveloped” feet. About 10% of the bird species in this group are threatened or endangered.</dd>

        <dt><b>Kiwis & Extinct Birds (Apterygiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>The next group of birds belongs to order Apterygiformes, which is composed of flightless birds that live on the ground, such as the famous Kiwi – the national bird of New Zealand. A unique feature of these monogamous kiwis is their long, flexible beak with a downward curve on the end. Most bird species in this order are extinct now.</dd>

        <dt><b>Hornbills & Hoopoes (Coraciiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>These types of birds were previously belonged to order Coraciiformes. However, now they are classified into a separate order of their own called Bucerotiformes. This order includes hornbills, hoopoes, and woodhoopoes. The prominent feature of all birds in this taxonomy is their large and hard bills.</dd>

        <dt><b>Nightjars, Frogmouths & Oilbirds (Caprimulgiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>The next type of birds belongs to the order Caprimulgiformes. This group includes birds such as Nightjars (such as Great Eared Nightjars), Frogmouths, and Oilbirds. These birds have large heads with large eyes and are mainly nocturnal. They primarily feed on insects.</dd>

        <dt><b>Seriemas (Cariamiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Both present-day and extinct species of birds belong to this bird order  Cariamiformes such as Seriemas. These birds are terrestrial birds that live on the ground and seldom fly. Interestingly, the heads of seriemas are similar to the heads of hawks. Seriemas are restricted to South America only.</dd>

        <dt><b>Emus & Cassowaries (Casuariiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Casuariiformes order contains two families of flightless terrestrial birds that are both native to Australia: emus and cassowaries. Previously these herbivorous birds were grouped with Kiwis but later classified into their order now. These monogamous birds are enormous and heavy, up to 55 kgs. Females are usually larger than males.</dd>

        <dt><b>Shorebirds (Charadriiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Charadriiformes is one of the very most extensive bird orders. There are about 350 bird species in it. Surprisingly, these birds have varied in size from 0.006 to 4.4 pounds. As the name suggests, shorebirds live near the water: in wetlands, freshwater, seawater shorelines, and sometimes near the ocean. Some examples of shorebirds include the Great auk, Crested Auklet, Horned Puffin, and African Jacana.</dd>

        <dt><b>Storks, Herons & Vultures (Ciconiiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>The next group of birds also live near the water or are fully aquatic is called Ciconiiformes. Most Ciconiiformes have long necks, long beaks, and feet without webbing. The plumage of most species in the order combines the most uncomplicated colors – grey, white, and black. Currently, 21 species of Ciconiiformes are seriously threatened.</dd>

        <dt><b>Mousebirds (Coliiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Coliiformes is the smallest bird order which consists of only 6 species of tiny mousebirds. These mousebirds are found in sub-Saharan Africa. These herbivorous birds are social and often found in small groups. Coliiformes nest in colonies.</dd>

        <dt><b>Pigeons and Dodos (Columbiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Columbiformes order embraces both extinct and living species of pigeons (or doves), as well as the famous dodos. Pigeons are known for feeding their young “bird milk” very similar to the milk of mammals. The species of this order can be found almost everywhere.</dd>

        <dt><b>Kingfishers, Rollers, & Bee-eaters (Coraciiformes)</b></dt>
        <dd>Coraciiformes is a diverse and colorful bird order which includes kingfishers, rollers, and bee-eaters. Most of the species spend a significant part of their life on trees. Ornithologists consider rollers the leading family of this order.</dd>

    <div class="header"><h2><b>Most Popular Birds</b></h2></div>
    <div class="b1">
        <dt><b>1. Parakeet</b></dt>
        <dd>This bird sits at the top of the list of most popular pet birds in the world for multiple reasons. Parakeets (also called Budgies or Budgerigars) are tiny parrot versions with long tail feathers. 

            Theyre available in various colors: blue, gray, white, violet, and yellow/blue. But one of the most captivating variations is the light green Parakeet with striking black wing markings and yellow head. 
            
            The parakeet bird is one of the most popular parrots and the
            best bird as a pet due to its friendly nature and aesthetic feathers. 
            The innate intelligence of this bird makes the species more fascinating because it allows you to train them to talk and perform some tricks. 

            On top of that, this pet bird is low-maintenance. 
            
            No wonder over 25% of bird parents keep a parakeet as their beloved pets.
            
            If you want an easygoing bird with a low noise level, pretty feathering, and playful side, a tiny Parakeet with a big personality may be the one for you.</dd>
    </div>
    <div class="b2">
            <dt><b>2. Cockatiels</b></dt>
            <dd>Gracing the second spot in our most popular pet bird species list is the cockatiel, a medium-sized parrot with a distinct yellow crown. 

                These native Australians are renowned for their astonishingly talented singing and whistling. 
                
                Even though cockatiels can learn to speak, many owners discover that their birds prefer to whistle and imitate odd noises like the ringing of a telephone.
                
                Cockatiels are lovely first birds for families with children since they are full of personality and simple to handle. 
                
                Well-socialized cockatiels recognize and respond to their owners, making them excellent companions that can converse and sing.
                
                Care Tips for Cockatiels:
                They need a medium-sized cage that is approximately 24″ x 24″ x 24″, is lined with newspaper, has a variety of perches, and has at least two feeding stations (one for dry food and the other for moist food) as well as a water cup.

            </dd>
        </div>
        <div class="b3">
            <dt><b>3. Canaries</b></dt>
            <dd>If you want a bird you can listen to rather than cuddle, this songbird that sits at the third spot of the most popular pet birds may be the one for you!

                After six months of age, the male canaries are renowned for their lovely, operatic songs because theyre proud members of the passerine (songbird) family. 
                
                They are raised to produce particular tunes, like the American singer, the German roller, and others. 
                
                The canaries may be highly territorial and should be housed separately if possible. During the breeding season (usually the spring, in reaction to changes in the light cycle), males sing to compete for females.
                
                 A male can sing without being in the sight of a female, and he might even sing louder when living next to another male in a cage.
                
                Theyre usually available in yellow or green, bright orange or brown variations. 
                
                </dd>
            </div>
            <div class="b4">
                <dt><b>4. Lovebirds</b></dt>
                <dd>The fourth on our list of most popular pet birds may be tiny, but they should not be overlooked at any cost. 

                    These parrots are as lovely as their name because of their amiable personality and intelligence. 
                    
                    These birds test boundaries and sometimes try to show dominance through nipping or aggression. 
                    
                    Lovebirds are so named because of the close relationships they develop with both their owners and their partners. 
                    
                    Contrary to popular belief, lovebirds need not be kept in pairs. 
                    
                    In fact, a solitary bird is better if you want an animal eagerly attached to its human flock. 
                    
                    Having a pair of lovebirds can also make for a beautiful company as owners wont have as much responsibility for meeting their social demands.
                    
                    
                    On the brighter side, these birds are relatively quiet. 
                    
                    Thats why theyre perfect for those who live in apartments or condominiums. 
                    
                    Lovebirds are primarily green with orange upper body and head, light blue lower back and rump, red beak, and white eyerings.</dd>

                <div class="b5">
                    <dt><b>5. Dove</b></dt>
                    <dd>Of all the most popular pet birds in America, the dove is perhaps the sweetest and gentlest. 

                        Doves are not overly demanding of their owners attention, so theyre easy to take care of. Thats why theyre perfect for people with busy schedules or who can’t be home. 
                        
                        Theyre best suited to bird owners with children that know the importance of gentle handling. 
                        
                        These birds need a large cage because they like to fly from perches to perches. 
                        
                        Rarely do softbill doves attempt to bite or cause harm with their beaks. However, using gentle, upbeat socialization and bonding tactics with these birds is always beneficial.
                        
                        
                        Doves require company as well. Theyd love it if they could interact with their humans out of the cage. 
                        
                        But if you want to keep them entertained inside their cage, you need to put mirrors and swings that they can play with. 
                        
                        Doves are usually white and gray, but you may also find white with gray, tangerine, pied, and orange versions. 
                        
                        They feature black eyes and bill, and they have dark purple feet. </dd>
